# IoT-Based-Detection-of-Covid-19-s-Symptoms-Patient
This is an intern project at Pusat Penelitian Tenaga Listrik dan Mekatronik, Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia (LIPI).

This project has been built to detection of the clinical symptoms of Covid-19 such as body temperatur, blood oxygen level, heartrate and ECG monitoring, and respiration monitoring using a wearable body sensor. The devices we use for this research including DS18B20 as body temp sensor, MAX30102 as blood oxygen level and heartrate sensor, AD8232 for ECG monitoring, MPU6050 for repirational monitoring, and ESP8266 for microcontroller that can be online transferring data.
